##Project 2 
The codes' files of the project 2 are in the folder Project 2. \
Seperate chaining hashing is used to implement a biology problem. \
Given a string, there is an associated set of k-mer(especially 3-mers) which represent each consecutive sequence of 3-symbols from the string\
In my understanding, this string can be a DNA sequence. \
These codes can help us manipulate the statistic of 3-mers in a string dynamically by using hashtable and linked list.\
